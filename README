Original code from JeeLabs http://news.jeelabs.org/code/

forked by Adafruit

and then forked by me... rlameiro :D

The only modification I made, was to add a little class/function to allow to set the time directly via the microcontroller.

so, calling:

RTC_DS1307.set(hour, min, sec, day, month, year-4digit)

you set the DS1307 clock.
