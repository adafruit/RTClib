This is a fork of JeeLab's fantastic real time clock library for Arduino.

Works for DS1307, DS3231 AND MCP7940 (need to change #define in .cpp)

For details on using this library with an RTC module like the DS1307, see the guide at: https://learn.adafruit.com/ds1307-real-time-clock-breakout-board-kit/overview

To download. click the DOWNLOADS button to the right, and rename the uncompressed folder RTClib.

Place the RTClib folder in your *arduinosketchfolder*/libraries/ folder. 
You may need to create the libraries subfolder if its your first library. Restart the IDE.
